# DetectingB12levels
This project aims to detect a person's B12 level by looking him/her psychology and mental health.

## Problem
Psychology and mental health problems are really common in this century. And the lack of vitamin B12 causes some other big health problems like anemia, forgetfulness, neurologic, gastrointestinal problems, etc. Psychology problems can occur for many reasons such as childhood traumas, private life, family problems, work-life, and so on.
B12 of a person can be low, normal, or high. Depending on the medical articles, the lower limit of B12 is 200pg/ml and should not be lower than 300pg/ml. Smaller than 300pg/ml values are really low levels for B12 and this can cause a person to stay at the hospital for days. But doctors suggest using oral supplements if B12 is lower than 500pg/ml.

## Aim
As mentioned above, the result of the B12 level will be either low, medium, or high. And this is a classification problem with three categories.

## Data
The 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)' is online dataset repository at www.cdc.gov. Starting from 1999, there are total of 11 datasets, one for each two years. In this project, selected years are 2013-2014 depending on the large amount of B12 data. There is a total of 14,332 persons who attended the survey.
